        <h1>Kara no Kyoukai</h1>
        <p>A series of 7 films that tells the story of a murderer, split personality, and absurdism</p>

        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>Kara no Kyoukai takes place in the Type Moon universe and thus is distantly related to 
          other shows created by Nasu including Fate Zero, Tsukihime, and Fate Stay Night. This piece
          of information is not actually relevant unless the viewer is inclined to analyze all of the Nasu's'
          works as a whole and examine their overarching existentialist themes. Kara no Kyoukai itself was 
          released out of chronological order, providing a thought intensive experience for the viewer (of course
          one can always choose to watch the movies in the order they happen in the story). </p>
          
          <h2>The Movies</h2>
          <p>The movies are (in the order they were released): Overlooking View,  </p>
          
          <h1>The Crux of the Show (as according to me)</h1>
           <p>Imagine an empty body that was forced to hold two different personalities. 
             Was there ever a void, an empty container of a human, to begin with? Shiki Ryougi, the protagonist of the films,
             has a male and female personality within her, one which is a murderer and the other which adopts the role of an 
             aloof school girl. She ultimately loses the male personality after a life or death experience, resulting in her acquired 
             Mystics Eyes of Death Perception. Her personality ultimately melds into one being, consisting of elements of both Male
             Shiki and female Shiki, representing a balance between Yin and Yang. </p>
